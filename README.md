# quick-dashboard

## What is this?
A dashboard that doesnt need (or appear to need) a full web server stack. Something local, LAN, or BT that a person could imprompty pop up on a display for group work without standing up infra or internet security postures. Markdown or similar input, maybe a timer, check lists. Picture cleaning out a room with friends and having the action plan on a monitor

Right down to who is eyes on a situation and who is doing background work; impromptu signage etc.
